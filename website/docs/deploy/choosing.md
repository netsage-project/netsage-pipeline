## Manual or BareMetal Installation

The Manual (bare-metal) Installation Guide will walk you through installing the pipeline using your own server infrastructure and requires you to maintain all the components involved.

It will likely be a bit better when it comes to performance, and have greater flexibility, but there is also more complexity involved in configuring and setting up.

If you are the ultimate consumer of the data then setting up a bare-metal version might be worth doing. 

## Dockerized Version

The Docker version makes it easier to bring up the pipeline. More of the work is done for you. 

If you are simply using the pipeline to deliver the anonymized network stats for someone else's consumption (eg, sending Netsage data to IU), then using the docker pipeline would be preferred.
