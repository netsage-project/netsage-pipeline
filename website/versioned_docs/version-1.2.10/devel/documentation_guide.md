title: Revising Documentation

This project's documentation uses Docusaurus.

Docusaurus converts markdown into html and builds a static website using React UI components, which can be exported to a webserver.

Yarn is a package manager for JavaScript and replaces the npm client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

To extend the docs simply create a markdown file and reference the ID in the side bar config. Please see the related documentation
at the [docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/) project website.

*THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS ARE NOT CONFIRMED TO WORK. PLEASE UPDATE WITH CORRECTIONS.*

## If Not Using Docker
These are instructions for editing and releasing docs without using Docker.

### Installation

To get started the first time, install npm, then use that to install yarn 
```
$ sudo yum install npm
$ sudo npm install -g yarn 
```

Git clone the netsage pipeline project, then run yarn install to get all the dependencies listed within package.json
```
$ cd netsage-pipeline/website
$ yarn install
```

### Local Development

If you are working on your local machine, you can view changes to the docs in a browser as you work. Use the following commands to generate the static website content (gets written into the build directory), then start a local development server and open up a browser window in which to view the docs. Most changes you make will be reflected live without having to restart the server.
```
$ yarn build  
$ yarn start
go to http://localhost:3000
```

### To Make Changes
Whether on a local machine or a linux host, to make changes, edit the files in website/docs/.
When finished, git add, git commit, git push, as usual.
Repeat as needed.


### Tagging a New release

When it's time to release a new version of the Pipeline, you need to create a new version of the docs as well. 

Once the documentation is stable and you don't forsee any new change, please do the following:

```
$ yarn run docusaurus docs:version a.b.c
```

replacing a.b.c with the next release version number.  
This will create new versioned docs in website/versioned_docs/.

Then edit docusaurus.config.js and change `lastVersion:` to refer to the new version number. 

Finally, commit and push the following to github:
  * website/versioned_docs/version-a.b.c/
  * website/versioned_sidebars/version-a.b.c.sidebars.json
  * versions.json 
  * docusaurus.config.js


### Deploying Docs to github.io
Whether you have created a new set of versioned tags or just want to update the docs in "master", to make changes appear at https://netsage-project.github.io/netsage-pipeline, do the following.

If Travis or some other CI is working, it will run yarn install and yarn deploy to do this automatically.

If it is not, do it manually:
```
$ USE_SSH="true" GIT_USER="your-username" yarn deploy   
```
replacing your-username.  This sets a couple env vars then runs 'yarn deploy' which runs 'docusaurus deploy' (see package.json) which pushes the static website created to url: "https://netsage-project.github.io" (see docusaurus.config.js) 

NOTE: You need to have created ssh keys on the host you are running this on and added them to your github account. 

### Removing a version 

To remove version 1.2.6 for example.

we need to: 

  * update versions.json to remove the reference
  * remove the versioned_docs/version-1.2.6
  * remove versioned_sidebars/version-1.2.6-sidebars.json

## If Using Docker

You may also use a docs Docker container to simplify installation, making changes, and deployment.  This method starts a local web server that allows you to see changes to the docs in a browser on your local machine, as they are made.

### Build and Start the Container

Git clone the netsage pipeline project then build and start the container. 
The Dockerfile in website/ tells how to build an image that runs yarn.  Docker-compose.yml brings up a docs container.
```
$ cd netsage-pipeline/website
$ docker-compose build build_docs
$ docker-compose up -d docs
go to http://localhost:8000/netsage-pipeline/
```

### To Make Changes
Whether on a local machine or a linux host, to make changes, edit the files in website/docs/.
When finished, git add, git commit, git push, as usual.
Repeat as needed.

### Tagging a New release

When it's time to release a new version of the Pipeline, you need to create a new version of the docs as well. 

Once the documentation is stable and you don't forsee any new change, please do the following:

```
$ docker-compose build build_docs
$ docker-compose run  docs yarn run docusaurus docs:version  a.b.c
```
replacing a.b.c with the next release version number.  
This will create new versioned docs in website/versioned_docs/.

Then edit docusaurus.config.js and change `lastVersion:` to refer to the new version number. 

Finally, commit and push the following to github:
  * website/versioned_docs/version-a.b.c/
  * website/versioned_sidebars/version-a.b.c.sidebars.json
  * versions.json 
  * docusaurus.config.js


### Deploying Docs to github.io
How to do this when using Docker ??? Get into the container ???

For now, go a linux server that has yarn installed and
follow the instructions under If Not Using Docker.
