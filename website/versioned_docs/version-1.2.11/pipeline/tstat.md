## Netsage GitHub Project

[Tstat](http://tstat.polito.it/) is a passive sniffer that provides insights into traffic patterns.  The Netsage [tstat-transport](https://github.com/netsage-project/tstat-transport) project provides client programs to parse the captured data and send it to a rabbitmq host where it can then be processed by the [logstash pipeline](logstash), stored in elasticsearch, and finally displayed in our Grafana [dashboards](https://github.com/netsage-project/netsage-grafana-configs).

## Docker 

Netsage Docker images exist on Docker Hub for tstat and tstat_transport. This is still in a beta state and is in development.  The initial documentation is available [here](https://github.com/netsage-project/tstat-transport/blob/master/docs/docker.md).
