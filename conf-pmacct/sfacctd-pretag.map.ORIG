! This file is referenced in the sfacctd config file and used to set the "label" field
! which is parsed to obtain and set the sensor name.
!
! After the setup script runs, label should be "sfacct--" for sflow
! followed by the sensor name with spaces replaced by #'s.
! No commas are allowed in the sensor name!
! eg, set_label=sfacct--Sflow#Sensor

set_label=${sflowSensorName_1}
