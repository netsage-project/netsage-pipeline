! This file is referenced in the nfacctd config file and used to set the "label" field
! which is parsed to obtain and set the sensor name.
!
! After the setup script runs, label should be "nfacct--" for sflow
! followed by the sensor name with spaces replaced by #'s.
! No commas are allowed in the sensor name!
! eg, set_label=nfacct--Netflow#Sensor

set_label=${netflowSensorName_1}
