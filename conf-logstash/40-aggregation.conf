## Fields most likely to be specific to a logstash pipeline:
## These may be set via environment variables.
##    aggregate_maps_path  - must be unique for each pipeline. Aggregation info is written here if logstash exits. Default is /tmp/logstash-aggregation-maps.
##    inactivity_timeout   - value depends on timespan of nfcapd files. Default is 630 sec.
##    timeout - the maximum length of a flow.  Default is 1 day.
##    (trial - this may be useful for testing. Commented out by default.)

# This filter stitches together flows from different nfcapd files, each (usually) spanning a 5 min. period.
# Note: netflow keeps the start time the same for all flows with the same fingerprint, even across different nfcapd files;
# duration is cumulative but counts are not. Sflow just sends samples.
# If only 1 packet is seen, end time will = start time and duration will be 0.

# NOTE: tags added to events before this point in the pipeline aren't kept.

filter {

    # TSTAT - tstat only reports complete flows, so no stitching is needed!
    # Just add stitched_flows=0 (means no stitching attempted)

          # on the clock, assume the flow has ended.
          ##  Use 630 sec = 10.5 min for 5-min files,  960 sec = 16 min for 15-min files.
