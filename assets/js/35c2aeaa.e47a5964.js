The netsage pipeline then looks for matching packets to aggregate into flows. The sampling rate can be configured, eg, 1 out of every 100 packets. To approximately correct for the fact that most packets are not detected, one assumes that each sampled packet represents N others and multiplies the number of bytes in the sampled packet by the sampling rate N, eg, 100. The sampling rate compared to the number of packets per second flowing through the device determines how accurate this approximation is.

The end time (the time the last packet was observed) and duration change, but the number of bytes and packets reported corresponds only to the period since the last update.
