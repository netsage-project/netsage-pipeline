The sampling rate can be configured, eg, 1 out of every 100 packets. To approximately correct for the fact that most packets are not detected, one assumes that each sampled packet represents N others and multiplies the number of bytes in the sampled packet by the sampling rate N, eg, 100. The sampling rate compared to the number of packets per second flowing through the device determines how accurate this approximation is. Sampling is, of course, least accurate for shorter flows since their packets will be more likely to be missed and the correction applied may overestimate the number of packets and bytes. Discussions of accuracy and sampling rates can be found online. The netsage pipeline then looks for matching packets to aggregate into flows."),Object(a.b)("p",null,"Netflow also commonly samples packets, and the same sampling corrections apply, but it also keeps track of the flows and aggregates by the 5-tuple (source and destination IPs, ports, and protocol) on the router.

This means that for flows longer than 1 minute, a "netflow update" is sent out every minute. The tricky thing is that these update-flows all have the same start time (the time the first packet was observed). The end time (the time the last packet was observed) and duration change, but the number of bytes and packets reported corresponds only to the period since the last update.  The netsage pipeline attempts to combine these updates to aggregate long flows correctly.'))}l.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
